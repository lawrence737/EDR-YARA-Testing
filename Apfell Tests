Ran unmodified apfell in endpoint, blocked by Enterprise EDR Solution 2.

Moved osascript binary (and removed signature because of  AMFI), reran the same apfell script. 

cp /usr/bin/osascript /var/tmp/launchd
codesign --remove-signature /var/tmp/launchd
/var/tmp/launchd index.js

Removed all the comments from the apfell script, reran with an osascript binary downloaded from Slack (an attacker could have sent a zip with apfell and the osascript binary).
